chapter 9
1 What is a relative path relative to?

   relative path is relative to  *current working directory*. It specifies location in relation to where you are currently in the file system, rather than from the root of the file system



2 What does an absolute path start with?

   An absolute path starts from the *root directory* of the file system. On Windows, it starts with a drive letter (e.g., C:/)


3 What does Path('C:/Users') / 'Al' evaluate to on Windows?

   This evaluates to the path C:/Users/Al. The / operator is overloaded in the pathlib module to join paths in a way that's platform-appropriate, so on Windows it results in C:/Users/Al.



4 What does 'C:/Users' / 'Al' evaluate to on Windows?

   This will result an error because the 'C:/Users' string is a regular string, not a Path object. To use path operations like /, 'C:/Users' must be converted to a Path object, like this: Path('C:/Users') / 'Al'



5.What do the os.getcwd() and os.chdir() functions do?

   - os.getcwd() returns the *current working directory* as a string.
   - os.chdir(path) changes the *current working directory* to the specified path


6.What are the . and .. folders?

   - . refers to the **current directory
   - .. refers to the **parent directory (the directory one level above the current directory)



7 In C:\bacon\eggs\spam.txt, which part is the dir name, and which part is the base name?

   - The *dir name* is C:\bacon\eggs.
   - The *base name* is spam.txt.



8.What are the three “mode” arguments that can be passed to the open() function?

   The three common "mode" arguments are:
   - 'r': Read (default mode). Opens the file for reading.
   - 'w': Write. Opens the file for writing (creates a new file or truncates an existing file).
   - 'a': Append. Opens the file for appending (creates a new file or writes at the end of the existing file).



9.What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?

   If an existing file is opened in write mode ('w'), the file is *truncated* to zero length, effectively deleting its contents, and then it is opened for writing



10 What is the difference between the read() and readlines() methods?

   - read(): Reads the entire file content as a single string.
   - readlines(): Reads the entire file content and returns it as a list of strings, with each string representing a line in the file



11.What data structure does a shelf value resemble?

    *shelf value* in the shelve module resembles a *dictionary*. It allows you to store key-value pairs, and the values can be any Python object that can be pickled
