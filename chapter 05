chapter 5 

1. The code for an empty dictionary 
   python
   {}
   

2.dictionary with a key 'foo' and a value 42
   python
   {'foo': 42}
   

3.  difference between a dictionary and  list is that dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, while lists are ordered collections of items accessed by their index positions.

4. If you try to access spam['foo'] and spam is {'bar': 100}, you will get a KeyError because 'foo' is not a key in spam.

5. 'cat' in spam checks if 'cat' is a key in spam, while 'cat' in spam.keys() explicitly checks the keys of spam to see if 'cat' is present. Both expressions are functionally the same, as in on a dictionary checks keys by default

6. 'cat' in spam checks if 'cat' is a key in spam, while 'cat' in spam.values() checks if 'cat' is a value in spam

7. A shortcut for  code
   python
   if 'color' not in spam:
       spam['color'] = 'black'
   
   is:
   python
   spam.setdefault('color', 'black')
   

8. The pprint module and its pprint function can be used to “pretty print” dictionary values
   python
   from pprint import pprint
   pprint(spam)
