chapter 6 

1. Escape characters are special characters in a string that are a backslash (\). allow you to include special characters, such as newline (\n) or tab (\t), or to escape quotes so they don't end the string prematurely
.
2. The \n escape character represents a newline  and \t represents a tab 

3. To put a backslash (\) character in a string, use a double backslash: \\

4. The string "Howl's Moving Castle" is valid because the string is enclosed in double quotes ("), allowing the single quote (') within the string to used without needing to  escaped.

5.  write a string with newlines without using \n, you can use triple quotes:
   python
   """This is
   a string
   with newlines."""
   

6.
   - 'Hello, world!'[1] → 'e'
   - 'Hello, world!'[0:5] → 'Hello'
   - 'Hello, world!'[:5] → 'Hello'
   - 'Hello, world!'[3:] → 'lo, world!'

7. 
   - 'Hello'.upper() → 'HELLO'
   - 'Hello'.upper().isupper() → True
   - 'Hello'.upper().lower() → 'hello'

8. 
   - 'Remember, remember, the fifth of November.'.split() → ['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'November.']
   - '-'.join('There can be only one.'.split()) → 'There-can-be-only-one.'

9. 
   - Right-justify: .rjust(width)
   - Left-justify: .ljust(width)
   - Center: .center(width)

10.  trim whitespace characters from the beginning or end of a string,
   - .strip() to remove whitespace from both ends
   - .lstrip() to remove whitespace from the beginning (left)
   - .rstrip() to remove whitespace from the end (right)
