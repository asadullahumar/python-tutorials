CHAPTER 02
Q&A



1 What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

The two values of the Boolean data type are:
True
False

2 What are the three Boolean operators?

The three Boolean operators are:
and
or
not

3 Truth tables for each Boolean operator 

AND table 
OR table 
NOT table

4 What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 = 5) → False
not (5 > 4) → False
(5 > 4) or (3 = 5) - True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 = 5)) - False
(True and True) and (True = False) - False
(not False) or (not True) - True

5 What are the six comparison operators?

= equal to
!= not equal to
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to

6 Difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator:

 == operator checks  two values are equal
 = operate a value to a variable

7 What is a condition and where would you use one?

 condition is an expression that evaluates  True or False and used in control flow statements if, while, or for loops 

8 Identify the three blocks in this code

     print('ham')

Block 1:  if statement.
Block 2: second if
Block 3:  else.

9 Write code that prints based on the value of spam:

spam = int(input("Enter the Value of Spam : ")) 

if spam == 1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
    print("Salam")
else:
    print("How Are You ! ") 

10 What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

 Ctrl + C 

11 Difference between break and continue:

break exits entire loop 
continue skips current iteration and moves  next iteration of  loop

12 Difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop:

range(10) make numbers from 0 to 9.
range(0, 10) makes numbers from 0 to 9
range(0, 10, 1) same 

13 Program to print numbers 1 to 10 using for and while loops:


for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
 
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1

14 How to call a function bacon() from a module spam:

import spam
spam.bacon() spam = 0
if spam == 10:           
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:         
        print('bacon')
    else:
